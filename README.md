# Oil Project (Paper)
-------------------------------------
Transformers are one of the most critical components in the power grid. Most power substation has laboratories to analysis the transformer oil. They are periodically sending transformer oil samples to the laboratory and classify oils with different aging. In this process, it is necessary to shut down the electrical power of the local grid.

In this project, we are developing an IoT device to analyze the transformer oil without shutting down the grid. By creating this device, the oil sampling and analysis process is done automatically and no longer need to cut off the grid.
